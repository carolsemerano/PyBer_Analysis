# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

This projects aims to analyse data from a ride-sharing company to compare the performance in urban, suburban, and rural cities. The anaylisis used jupyter notebook along with pandas and matplotlib to create compreehensive dataframes and data visualisations. The complete analysis can be found in [PyBer_Challenge.ipynb](PyBer_Challenge.ipynb).

## Results

- Summary Data Frame

    - Reviewing the summary dataframe, presented below, is possible to notice a significant difference in the numbers of rides and drivers in urban cities when compared to suburban and rural areas.
    - Although rural and suburban cities had fewer rides, the averages fare per ride are higher than in urban cities, which may indicate that the rides in rural and suburban cities are longer than urban rides.
    - Also, the average fare per driver in urban cities is considerably lower than in rural and suburban cities. That may occur due to the higher number of drivers in urban areas, which probably results in a smaller number of rides per driver.

- Fare Summary
    - The chart below shows how total fare for each type of city varies in the first quarter of 2019. In urban cities is possible to notice that January has the smallest total fare in the period. Still, the values grows steadily in February, then drops again by the begining of March, when ups and downs are present. In April the value present little variation, but tending to lower levels by the end of the month.
    - For suburban cities, there are peaks by the end of February and April. But in the latest, the curve grows steadily, which may indicate that the level with be constant from that point. The lower levels can be seen by the begining of January and Aprin.
    - In rural cities, total fare present small variations all over the period, without any clear trend. The highest peak can be notice by the begining of April. However, it tend downwards right after.

## Summary

The analysis has shown that ride-sharing prevails on urban cities, still fares are higher in suburban and rural areas. Based on this scenario, some recommendatins include:
- Focus on attracting new drivers in rural and suburban areas, expanding the offer of ride-sharing in these cities.
- Review fare policies to decrease the disparity between fare per driver in urban, suburban, and rural areas.
- Conduct further research to examine the reasons of variations in the total fare observed in the line chart.
